Models
1. Cci
2. Child
3. Attendance

In CCI INFO Ejs page

1. Two objects are passed ... cci(contains all cci of jhansi) and child(contains all documents of child collection.)
2. In the cciInfo.ejs page two for loops are executed,  one for CCi for getting info of each CCI and the second inside that, for matching the cciId of each cci with all documents    of child in Child collection and to store it for strength in each CCi.
   and then For attendance page CCI Id of every CCI are matched with each document in the attendance collection to show present and absent.
